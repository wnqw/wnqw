I am Wenqing Wang (王文青), a CS PhD candidate at [Khoury College of Computer Sciences](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/), [Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu/). I am advised by [Prof. Yun Raymond Fu](https://www1.ece.neu.edu/~yunfu/) and am a member of the [Synergetic Media Learning Lab](https://fulab.sites.northeastern.edu/). I earned my B.S. in Computer Science and B.A. in Psychology from the [University of California, Davis](https://www.ucdavis.edu/).

My research interests span computer vision, generative AI, and artificial intelligence. In particular, I focus on:

* Generative AI [VLMs/LLMs, multi-modal generation, diffusion models, video and image generation/understanding]
* Neural Rendering [NeRF, Gaussian Splatting, 3D novel-view synthesis]
* Artificial Intelligence [ML/DL, brain-inspired algorithms, attention mechanisms, autonomous driving, AI-driven longevity/health research]. 

I am always open to collaboration.
