I'm currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Computer Science at Northeastern University's Khoury College, under the guidance of [Prof. Yun Raymond Fu](https://www1.ece.neu.edu/~yunfu/) at [Synergetic Media Learning Lab](https://fulab.sites.northeastern.edu/). My research broadly include Computer Vision and Artificial Intelligence. Specifically, I focus on:


* Neural Rendering [3D novel-view synthesis, NeRF, Gaussian Splatting]
* Generative AI [VLMs, LLMs, multi-modal generations, diffusion, video and image generation/understanding]
* Artificial Intelligence [AGI, ASI, machine learning, autonomous driving, embodied AI]
