- ðŸ‘‹ Hi! Iâ€™m Wenqing, a PhD student at Northeastern University. My research focus is representing human cognition and behavior in autonomous agents/robots and improving their abilities in acquiring knowledge about the environments. My research also focuses on real-world applications of reinforcement learning and intelligent autonomous agents.
